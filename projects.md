# Projects

## Ocean-Atmospheric Coupled Model COAWST
This project focuses on employing the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere-Wave-Sediment Transport (COAWST) model to study cyclone dynamics. Cyclones are critical components of atmospheric and oceanic interactions, impacting coastal regions worldwide. By leveraging COAWST, this research aims to simulate and analyze the complex processes involved in cyclone formation, intensification, and propagation. Insights gained from this study will contribute to enhancing predictive capabilities regarding cyclone behavior under varying environmental conditions, thereby informing strategies for disaster preparedness and resilience in vulnerable coastal areas.

## Climate Change and Variability Research
This project focuses on applying advanced machine learning techniques—Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)—to study climate change and variability in ocean-atmospheric science. The ocean and atmosphere interact intricately, influencing global climate patterns and phenomena like El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD).

CNNs are utilized to analyze spatial patterns in sea surface temperature, ocean currents, and atmospheric circulation, providing insights into the dynamics of climate-related phenomena across different spatial scales. RNNs are employed to model temporal dependencies in climate data, capturing trends and variability over time, crucial for understanding long-term climate change trends and predicting future scenarios.

Additionally, KNN algorithms are applied for clustering oceanographic and atmospheric data, identifying similarities and patterns that contribute to climate variability studies. These techniques collectively enable comprehensive analysis of complex climate interactions and their implications for global climate change.

The outcomes of this research aim to enhance our understanding of climate processes, improve climate models' predictive accuracy, and inform strategies for mitigating the impacts of climate change on oceanic and atmospheric systems. This interdisciplinary approach bridges oceanography, atmospheric science, and machine learning, contributing valuable insights to both scientific research and environmental policy-making.
