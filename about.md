# About Me

Quarks is a dedicated ocean-atmospheric researcher specializing in climate change and variability. Expertise encompasses key climate phenomena such as El Ni√±o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). Leveraging advanced techniques in deep learning with PyTorch and machine learning frameworks, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), drive impactful insights into climate dynamics. Research focuses on developing robust models that enhance our understanding and predictive capabilities of complex climate interactions, contributing to sustainable environmental practices and informed policy decisions.
